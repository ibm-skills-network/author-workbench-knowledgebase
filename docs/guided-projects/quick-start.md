# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first Guided Project (GP) in Author Workbench.

## What is a Guided Project (GP)?

Guided projects are short, interactive lessons that you can finish in one sitting, usually in less than an hour. They guide learners step-by-step to complete a real project.

For example, a good guided project might be building and deploying a movie recommender using Node.js. As an author, you would first make this project yourself and then write easy-to-follow instructions for learners. With Author Workbench, creating these projects is simple, and learners can join in without needing to set anything up. Each guided project should have at least one hands-on lab. The lab will be where you provide the instructions and we provide the environment for learners to follow along.

## Steps to Create and Publish a Guided Project

### 1. Plan Out Your GP
#### Define the Purpose and Audience
- Identify the topic and scope of the GP.
- Determine the target audience (e.g., beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners).
- Understand the learners' prior knowledge and expectations.

#### Set Clear Learning Objectives
- Define what learners should be able to accomplish after completing the GP.
- Use measurable goals (e.g., *"By the end of this GP, learners will be able to..."*).

#### Research and Gather Resources
- Collect reliable and up-to-date information on the topic.
- Identify relevant examples, case studies, or real-world applications.
- Gather necessary tools, software, or datasets if applicable.

#### Plan the Structure and Flow
- Break down the content into logical sections or steps.
- Use a progressive approach (start with basics and gradually increase complexity).
- Ensure each section builds upon the previous one.


### 2. Open Author Workbench
- Go to the Author Workbench.
- On the left side, choose **Guided Projects (GP)**.

### 3. Create a Guided Project (GP)
- On the top right corner, click **Create Guided Project**.


### 4. Select Your Creation Option
You will see several options for creating your GP:

- **Create a practice project**: Ideal for your first GP. This GP is meant for experimenting purpose only and is not meant to be published.
- **I want to do it myself**: Fully customize your own GP from scratch.

In this Quick Start guide, we will focus on the `I want to do it myself` option. 

### 5. Add Metadata

> **Tip:** You can edit the title, short description, long description, cover image and other metadata after your GP is created.

> Make sure to optimize all metadata for SEO, ensuring they contain keywords that would help learners find your project. In addition, try to write engaging and enticing descriptions that will convince learners that your guided project is worth doing. We recommend you spare any boring details here and focus instead on the value learners will gain from completing your project.

Below is the list of all the fields you must fill in before proceeding:

- **Title**: This is the first thing learners will see, make it interesting!
- **Platform**: Select **Skills Network Portals** unless otherwise instructed.
- **Language**: Choose the language for your GP.
- **Topic**: Select the most relevant topic for your GP.
- **Difficulty Level**: Consider the skill level of your intended audience.
- **Offered By**: Select the organization you're contributing on behalf or, or yourself if this is an independent project.
- **Skills**: Select the skills this project will help build.
- **Industry**: Leave this blank unless your project is specifically intended for learners in a particular industry.
- **Short Description**: Write a brief (160-character) description for your GP. Follow the tip above for a good short description.
- **Long Description**: Follow the provided template, and modify it after the project is created. Follow the tip above for a good long description.
- **Release Date**: Choose a tentative release date, you can always change this.

Once finished, click **Create Guided Project**. The page will refresh, and you will be redirected to the landing page of your newly created GP.

### 6. Create Your Lab

Labs are a crucial component of Guided Projects, it's where learners will follow along and build your project. A popular general-purpose lab tool we provide is Cloud IDE. This environment provides a code editor and a terminal with your instructions on one half of the screen. This seamless integration eliminates the need for package installations or switching between environments, making it easier for learners to focus on the building aspects of your project.

- Go to the "Labs" tab of your guided project
- In the top right corner, click **Create Lab**. This will create a new lab and add it as a resource in your guided project. Labs are reusable, so you can incorporate them into other guided projects and courses.
- Alternatively, you can click the dropdown next to "Create Lab" to add existing labs you wish to reuse.

> **Tip**: When designing your lab, ensure it aligns with the learning objectives of your Guided Project. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that build upon the knowledge gained in previous sections. Consider incorporating real-world applications or case studies to enhance the learning experience. For more detailed guidance, visit [**Labs - Quick Start**](/labs/quick-start).

### 7. Submit your GP for Review
- Once you feel your GP is complete and ready for learners to start taking it, you can submit it for review.
- Start by clicking **Submit for Review**. You will have a chance to review the team details here, then review the project details and finally confirm you'd like to submit for review.
- Once you submit for review, a member of our editorial team will be assigned to review your project. If any changes are required you'll get detailed feedback and have the opportunity to resubmit for review. If everything looks good, it will be approved and available on the Skills Network Catalog. Keep an eye on your email!

### 8. Congratulations, your GP is published!

#### How do learners access my guided project?

Learners do not access your guided project directly through Author Workbench. Instead, they will access your guided project through a [Skills Network Portal](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise).

To use a simplified analogy, think of yourself as a mobile app developer and your guided project as a mobile app. Author Workbench is your development environment and the [Skills Network Catalog](https://catalog.skills.network/) is the app store. Skills Network Portals are like the phones that install a copy of the app and allow users to launch the apps.

As a Skills Network Author, you can easily create guided projects for [Skills Network Portals](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise). This includes our community initiative, [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai). However, publishing to other destinations such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/partners/ibm-skills-network) or [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/school/ibm) will require you to be a partner with that destination.
