## Steps to Create and Publish a Guided Project (GP)

### 1. Plan Out Your GP
#### Define the Purpose and Audience
- Identify the topic and scope of the GP.
- Determine the target audience (e.g., beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners).
- Understand the learners' prior knowledge and expectations.

#### Set Clear Learning Objectives
- Define what learners should be able to accomplish after completing the GP.
- Use measurable goals (e.g., *"By the end of this GP, learners will be able to..."*).

#### Research and Gather Resources
- Collect reliable and up-to-date information on the topic.
- Identify relevant examples, case studies, or real-world applications.
- Gather necessary tools, software, or datasets if applicable.

#### Plan the Structure and Flow
- Break down the content into logical sections or steps.
- Use a progressive approach (start with basics and gradually increase complexity).
- Ensure each section builds upon the previous one.


### 2. Open Author Workbench
- Go to the Author Workbench.
- On the left side, choose **Guided Projects (GP)**.
![Sidebar menu of the Author Workbench platform under the Skills Network. The menu includes navigation options such as Home, Guided Projects, Courses, Articles & GPs, Videos, and Labs. The "Guided Projects" option is highlighted with a red outline, indicating it is selected or emphasized.](/img/guided-projects/awb-gp.png "AWB side bar")

### 3. Create a Guided Project (GP)
- On the top right corner, click **Create Guided Project**.
![Screenshot of a webpage section titled 'Guided Projects' with a description explaining that guided projects help people learn by doing. A search bar is visible below the text. On the right side, a prominent purple button with white text reads 'Create Guided Project,' outlined in red.](/img/guided-projects/create-gp.png "Create Guided Project button")


### 4. Select Your Creation Option
You will see several options for creating your GP:

- **Create a practice project**: Ideal for your first GP. This GP is meant for experimenting purpose only and is not meant to be published.
- **Create with AI (Preview)**: AI can help generate content based on your topic. However, it is strongly recommended to review all AI-generated content.
- **I want to do it myself**: Fully customize your own GP from scratch.

> **Tip:** If you select the AI option, carefully review and edit all generated content.

![Screenshot of the 'Create a Guided Project' page, which describes guided projects as short and interactive formats similar to writing a blog post. Below, three options for continuing are displayed: 'Create a practice project' (allows experimentation without submission requirements), 'Create with AI (Preview)' (an AI assistant helps create the project step by step), and 'I want to do it myself' (for users who already know how to create a guided project). The third option is highlighted in purple with a checkmark. A purple 'Continue' button is in the bottom right corner.](/img/guided-projects/gp-options.png "Guided Project Options")

In this Quick Start guide, we will focus on the `I want to do it myself` option. 

### 5. Fill Out Required Fields

> **Tip:** You can edit the title, short description, long description, and cover image even after your GP is created.

Instead of using the AI assistant, you can manually draft the GP front page yourself. When you select "I want to do it myself," you will be directed to the GP front page, which resembles the final page in the `Create with AI` option. Here, you will need to fill in all the details manually.

> Make sure to optimize the title, short description, and long description for SEO, ensuring they contain relevant keywords while staying true to the content of your GP.

Below is the list of all the fields you must fill in before proceeding:

- **Title**: Choose a descriptive and engaging title.
- **Platform**: Select **Skills Network Portals**.
- **Language**: Choose the language for your GP.
- **Topic**: Select the appropriate topic for your GP.
- **Difficulty Level**: Choose the difficulty level for your audience.
- **Provider**: Ensure **IBM Skills Network** is selected under "Who will this be offered by?"
- **Skills**: Select the skills this project will help build.
- **Industry**: Select the industry or leave blank if the GP is general.
- **Short Description**: Write a brief (160-character) description for your GP. Follow the tip above for a good short description.
- **Long Description**: Follow the provided template, and modify it after the project is created. Follow the tip above for a good long description.
- **Release Date**: Choose a tentative release date.

Once finished, click **Create Guided Project**. The page will refresh, and you will be redirected to the landing page of your newly created GP.

### 6. Create Your Lab
Use labs to create interactive and engaging learning experiences. These labs typically provide concise instructions alongside a browser-based code editor in CloudIDE or allow direct execution through a Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab. Learners can write, run, and deploy code seamlessly within the in-browser editorâ€”eliminating the need for package installations or switching between environments.

- On the top right corner, click **Create Lab**. This will create a brand new lab and add it as a resource in your guided project. You'll be able to reuse this lab in other guided projects and courses if you'd like!
- Alternatively, you can click the dropdown next to "Create Lab" and add in existing labs you would like to reuse

![Screenshot of the 'Labs' section in the Guided Project editor, where users can add, edit, and test labs. The interface displays a table listing existing labs, including columns for 'Name,' 'Tool,' 'Version,' and 'Owner.' A highlighted dropdown menu on the top right shows the 'Create Lab' button with three options: 'Add a Lab' (to select from public or shared labs), 'Add Labs from Another Course' (to reuse labs from a previous course), and 'Add Labs from Another Guided Project' (to adapt labs from a previously created Guided Project). Above the table, there are filtering options for 'Tool Type,' 'Owned By,' and 'Results per page.' At the top right, there are 'Preview Project' and 'Submit for Review' buttons.](/img/guided-projects/create-lab.png "Create lab for GP")

> **Tip**: Check out the [**Labs - Create a lab**](/labs/create-a-lab.md) wiki page to learn more about Skills Network labs and how to create a successful lab.

### 7. Submit your GP for Review
- Once you feel your GP is complete and ready for learners to start taking it, you can submit it for review.
- Start by clicking **Submit for Review**. You will have a chance to review the team details here, then review the project details and finally confirm you'd like to submit for review.
- Once you submit for review, a member of our editorial team will be assigned to review your project. If any changes are required you'll get detailed feedback and have the opportunity to resubmit for review. If everything looks good, it will be approved and available on the Skills Network Catalog. Keep an eye on your email!

### 8. Congratulations, your GP is published!
