# Using a Custom Outline

:::note
This is a setting for advanced users. For the vast majority of users, we do not expect you to need to configure this setting.
:::

[Author Workbench](https://author.skills.network) provides two ways to display your Guided Project to learners.
You can either create your own custom outline using Studio or use the simple outline we provide.

## To get started

To change your outline configuration, simply...
1. Open your Guided Project in Author Workbench and go to the `Advanced` tab
2. Scroll to the section labelled `Configure Your Project Outline (Advanced)`

### Using the Custom SN Studio Outline

If you are experienced and familiar with [Studio](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/getting_started/CA_get_started_Studio.html) you can fully customize your project's outline by selecting the `Use Custom SN Studio outline` option. This will let you use the full power of Studio to create your outline.

### Using the Simple Outline

When your Guided Project is created, it will be set up to use the simple outline by default. We will automatically create a simple outline for you that includes a **button to launch your lab**, a section for learners to **leave you feedback** and a section for learners to **mark completion**.
