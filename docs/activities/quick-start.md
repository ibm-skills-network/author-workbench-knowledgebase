# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first activity in Author Workbench.

## What is an Activity?

Activities are focused learning units where learners consume a single asset. Unlike Guided Projects which contain multiple resources, an activity contains just one:
- **A video** - An instructional or educational video
- **An assignment** - A single assessment or task
- **A lab** - A single hands-on interactive environment
- **A podcast** - An interactive audio 

Activities are perfect for bite-sized learning experiences that can be completed quickly and focused on a specific skill or concept.

## Steps to Create and Publish an Activity

### 1. Plan Out Your Activity
#### Define the Purpose and Audience
- Identify the specific topic or skill the activity will address.
- Determine the target audience (e.g., beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners).
- Understand the learners' prior knowledge and expectations.

#### Set a Clear Learning Objective
- Define what learners should be able to accomplish after completing the activity.
- Use a measurable goal (e.g., *"By the end of this activity, learners will be able to..."*).
- Keep it focused - activities should target a single, specific learning outcome.

#### Choose Your Asset Type
Decide which single asset type best fits your learning objective:
- **Video**: For demonstrating concepts, showing procedures, or providing explanations
- **Assignment**: For assessing understanding or practicing specific skills
- **Lab**: For hands-on practice in an interactive environment

#### Gather Resources
- Collect reliable and up-to-date information on the topic.
- Identify relevant examples or real-world applications.
- Gather necessary tools, software, or datasets if using a lab.


### 2. Open Author Workbench
- Go to the Author Workbench.
- On the left side, choose **Activities**.

### 3. Create an Activity
- On the top right corner, click **Create Activity**.

### 4. Add Metadata

> **Tip:** You can edit the title, short description, long description, cover image and other metadata after your activity is created.

> Make sure to optimize all metadata for SEO, ensuring they contain keywords that would help learners find your activity. In addition, write engaging and enticing descriptions that will convince learners that your activity is worth completing. Focus on the value learners will gain from completing your activity.

Below is the list of all the fields you must fill in before proceeding:

- **Title**: This is the first thing learners will see, make it clear and interesting!
- **Platform**: Select **Skills Network Portals** unless otherwise instructed.
- **Language**: Choose the language for your activity.
- **Topic**: Select the most relevant topic for your activity.
- **Difficulty Level**: Consider the skill level of your intended audience.
- **Offered By**: Select the organization you're contributing on behalf of, or yourself if this is an independent project.
- **Skills**: Select the skill this activity will help build.
- **Industry**: Leave this blank unless your activity is specifically intended for learners in a particular industry.
- **Short Description**: Write a brief (160-character) description for your activity.
- **Long Description**: Provide a clear description of what the learner will do and what they will gain.
- **Release Date**: Choose a tentative release date, you can always change this.

Once finished, click **Create Activity**. The page will refresh, and you will be redirected to the landing page of your newly created activity.

### 5. Add Your Asset

Now add the single asset that makes up your activity:
- Navigate to the **Content** tab of your activity
- Click the **Add Asset** button
- Select from the dropdown: **Video**, **Assignment**, **Lab**, or **Podcast**
- For each asset type, you'll have options to:
  - Create a new one
  - Add from the asset list
  - Add from courses/guided projects

#### Option A: Add a Video
- Select **Video** from the asset dropdown
- Choose to create new or add from existing sources
- If creating new, upload your video file or provide a link to a hosted video
- Add captions/subtitles if available
- Ensure the video is clear, well-paced, and focused on the learning objective

> **Tip**: Keep videos concise (typically 5-15 minutes). Use clear audio and visuals. Consider adding timestamps or chapters for longer videos.

#### Option B: Add an Assignment
- Select **Assignment** from the asset dropdown
- Choose to create new or add from existing sources
- If creating new, create your assignment questions or tasks
- Define clear instructions and expectations
- Set grading criteria or rubrics if applicable

> **Tip**: Make assignments specific and actionable. Provide examples if helpful. Align the assignment directly with your learning objective.

#### Option C: Add a Lab
- Select **Lab** from the asset dropdown
- Choose to create new or add from existing sources
- If creating new, choose the appropriate lab environment (e.g., Cloud IDE)
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for learners to follow
- Test the lab thoroughly to ensure it works as expected

> **Tip**: When designing your lab, ensure it aligns with the learning objective. Provide clear instructions and consider the learner's experience. For more detailed guidance, visit [**Labs - Quick Start**](/labs/quick-start).

#### Option D: Add a Podcast
- Select **Podcast** from the asset dropdown
- Choose to create new or add from existing sources
- If creating new, upload your audio file or provide a link to a hosted podcast
- Ensure the audio is clear and engaging
- Consider adding transcripts for accessibility

> **Tip**: Keep podcasts focused and engaging. Use clear audio quality. Consider breaking longer content into shorter episodes.

### 6. Submit Your Activity for Review
- Once you feel your activity is complete and ready for learners, you can submit it for review.
- Click **Submit for Review**. You will have a chance to review the details and confirm you'd like to submit for review.
- A member of our editorial team will be assigned to review your activity. If any changes are required, you'll get detailed feedback and have the opportunity to resubmit. If everything looks good, it will be approved and available on the Skills Network Catalog. Keep an eye on your email!

### 7. Congratulations, Your Activity is Published!

#### How do learners access my activity?

Learners do not access your activity directly through Author Workbench. Instead, they will access your activity through a [Skills Network Portal](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise).

To use a simplified analogy, think of yourself as a mobile app developer and your activity as a mobile app. Author Workbench is your development environment and the [Skills Network Catalog](https://catalog.skills.network/) is the app store. Skills Network Portals are like the phones that install a copy of the app and allow users to launch the apps.

As a Skills Network Author, you can easily create activities for [Skills Network Portals](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise). This includes our community initiative, [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai). However, publishing to other destinations such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/partners/ibm-skills-network) or [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/school/ibm) will require you to be a partner with that destination.
