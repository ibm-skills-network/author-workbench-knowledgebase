# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first course in Author Workbench.

## What is a Course?

Courses are large online learning experiences. They combine a mix of readings, labs, quizzes, videos, and more -- typically structured in 5 or more modules. Learners are meant to work through them at their own pace, this is also known as a self-paced course.

Author Workbench provides the tools to create and submit your course for review. Once approved, your course will be part of the [Skills Network Catalog](https://catalog.skills.network/) where our partners will be able to find and offer your course to their learners.

## Create a Course

You'll create your course in Author Workbench. Start by navigating to the [Courses](https://author.skills.network/courses) page and clicking "Create Course". You'll be asked for some information about your course here.

### Course Metadata

The course metadata is the information about your course that will be displayed to learners. This includes the title, description, and what skills learners will gain from completing your course.

Your metadata is critical to the success of your course. It is the first thing learners will see and will be used to determine if your course is a good fit for them.

Make sure to include keywords that learners would use to find your course. This will help your course be more visible to learners and improve your search rankings. In addition, try to write engaging and enticing descriptions that will convince learners that your course is worth taking. We recommend you spare any boring details here and focus instead on the value learners will gain from completing your course.

### Platforms

Author Workbench supports publishing to Skills Network Portals. This includes our community initiative, [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai). However, publishing to other destinations such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/partners/ibm-skills-network) or [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/school/ibm) will require you to be a partner with that destination. We recommend you only select Skills Network Portals as your platform unless otherwise instructed.

If you have access to publish on other platforms, you can check multiple platforms here. This will create a course for each platform you select and link them together for easy management.

### Offered By

Every course can be offered by an individual or an organization. If you joined Author Workbench as an independent author, simply select your name and the course will be offered by you. If you joined Author Workbench as part of an organization, please make sure you're a member of that [organization](https://author.skills.network/organizations?show=explore) in Author Workbench and select that organization as the 

### Expected Release Date

The expected release date is the date you'd like your course to be released. This is important as it helps our team plan for the release of your course. It is also useful to help you stay on track with your course development.

Like any estimate, this does not have to be exact. Pick a date you think is reasonable and update it as needed.

### Test Project

The Test Project option is exactly what it sounds like. It is a great way for you to create a temporary course and get familiar with the tools available to you. Check this option and your course will automatically be deleted after 30 days.

## Team Management

## The Course Outline

The course outline is the arrangement of the modules, lessons, and resources that make up your course. It is the order in which learners will work through your course.

Any resources you create in your course (such as labs or videos) must be added to the course outline to be visible to learners.

### Editing the Course Outline

To access your course outline, click the "Content" tab of your course and under "Course Outline", click "Edit in SN Studio". This will open your course outline editor in Skills Network Studio, which is our environment based on Open edX Studio.

For a detailed guide on how to use Skills Network Studio to build your course outline, refer to the [Open edX guides](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/educators/quickstarts/build_a_course.html#create-a-section).

## Publishing

Publishing your course is easy! But it can be a bit confusing to understand how learners will access your course at first.

### Submitting your course for review

Submitting your course for review is a three step process. Once you you think your course is ready for learners to enroll, you'll want to click the "Submit for Review" button. This will start the three step submission process. Here you will:

1. Review your course team
2. Review your course metadata
3. Confirm submission

Once you've submitted your course, you'll see that your course status has changed from "Draft" to "Awaiting Review". This means that the Skills Network team will review your course before it is made available to learners. If changes are needed, you'll receive an email with feedback and can make the necessary changes before submitting again. If your course is approved, it will be added to the [Skills Network Catalog](https://catalog.skills.network/) and made available to learners.

You can easily submit new versions of your course for review as you make changes. Note that you only need to submit new versions if you've made changes to the course outline. Metadata changes do not require a new submission.

### How do learners access my course?

Learners do not access your course directly through Author Workbench. Instead, they will access your course through a [Skills Network Portal](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise).

To use a simplified analogy, think of yourself as a mobile app developer and your course as a mobile app. Author Workbench is your development environment and the [Skills Network Catalog](https://catalog.skills.network/) is the app store. Skills Network Portals are like the phones that install a copy of the app and allow users to launch the apps.

As a Skills Network Author, you can easily create courses for [Skills Network Portals](https://skills.network/portals/enterprise). This includes our community initiative, [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai). However, publishing to other destinations such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/partners/ibm-skills-network) or [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/school/ibm) will require you to be a partner with that destination.
