## Common issues

### Narration is not reading my lab word for word

Our narration is designed to read your labs as naturally as possible.

Things like tables, images, bullet point lists, and other elements which cannot be read naturally may not be read at all.

If you want narration to read out your instructions, please make sure to write your instructions as naturally spoken language.
