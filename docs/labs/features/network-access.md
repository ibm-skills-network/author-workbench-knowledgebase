# Network Access

By default, learners are not allowed to access external resources from within Skills Network Labs.

This is an unfortunate necessity due to the potential for abuse.

To enable access to external resources for learners taking your lab, you will need to add an allowed destination to your course or guided project. This is called Network Egress.

From your course or guided project page, select the "Advanced" tab and scroll down to "Add access to external resources". From here you can add a URL and justification for why this domain needs to be accessible.


After the domain is added, the destination should be accessible within 15 minutes.
