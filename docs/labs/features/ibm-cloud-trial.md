## Markdown based labs

Currently feature codes are only supported with Markdown based labs. This includes Cloud IDE, Instructional labs, RStudio, and more.

## How to get the codes

If you need your learners to create an IBM Cloud account with a feature code follow the following steps:

1. Click `Edit` on the lab in [Author Workbench](https://author,skills.network)
2. This will Open Author IDE. Choose where in the instructions you want the learner to claim the code.
3. In the main menubar move mouse over `Cloud IDE` then click `Claim an IBM Cloud trial`
4. This will add a button in your instructions which will handle the rest!
