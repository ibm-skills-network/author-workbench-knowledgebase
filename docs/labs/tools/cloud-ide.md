# Cloud IDE
Cloud IDE is a browser integrated development environment running in the cloud. It supports many programming languages and tools right out of the box so that the users can start working right away without the hassle of tedious setups.
User interface of Cloud IDE, as shown below, comprises of course instructions on the left side and vscode-like development environment on the right side.

![Cloud IDE Screenshot interface showing an open project with a code editor, file explorer, and terminal](/img/labs/cloud-ide-screenshot.png)

There are three versions of CloudIDE available on Author Workbench: **normal CloudIDE**, **CloudIDE with Kubernetes** and **CloudIDE with Openshift**. Any information specific to only one version of CloudIDE will be clearly indicated below.

## Launch a terminal (all CloudIDE versions)
Click `Terminal` in the menu of the development environment(on the right side of the screen). Then from the dropdown select `New Terminal` and it should open up a new terminal for you.

## Docker (CloudIDE with Kubernetes, CloudIDE with Openshift)
Docker is an open source platform that is widely used to develop, ship and run applications. Cloud-IDE has built-in support for Docker. You can simply use `docker` cli to run commands. Internally, the docker client(in your IDE) talks to docker daemon, running on a remote host, over a TCP connection. Default user(theia) is configured to run docker commands. Docker commands don't require root privileges. So, don't preface commands with `sudo` or run them with root user. Some examples are:

```
docker version
```
It prints information about the docker client and engine.

```
docker container list
```
It lists the existing containers.

### Volume Mount Points (CloudIDE with Kubernetes, CloudIDE with Openshift)
Volume is mounted to persist data from a docker container. Currently, Cloud-IDE only allows mounting data from `/home/project` directory. For example:
```
docker run -itd --name my-first-container -v /home/project/testDir:/app ubuntu:latest
```
It spins up `my-first-container` using `ubuntu:latest` image and mounts `/home/project/testDir`(if it exists in your environment) to the `/app` directory  inside the container.

See the docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/) for more commands.

## Kubernetes (CloudIDE with Kubernetes)
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator which allows to schedule docker containers on large scale compute nodes. It is now a de-facto standard for cloud-native application development and deployment. Cloud-IDE with Kubernetes is already configured to support Kubernetes. It has a pre-installed command line tool called `kubectl` that handles communication with remote kubernetes cluster. Here are a few examples:
```
kubectl run my-first-pod --restart=Never --image=ubuntu -- sleep 10s
```
It creates a `my-first-pod` that runs a container using `ubuntu` image with `sleep 10s` command. This container spawns `sleep 10s` process.

```
kubectl get pods
```

It prints existing pods in your namespace.

More commands can be found in the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands)

## Embeddable AI (All CloudIDE versions)

Cloud IDE supports various Embeddable AI services includes Text-To-Speech, Speech-To-Text, and various Watson NLP services (e.g. sentiment, emotion, etc.). Learners have immediate access to all of these services (via HTTP API calls) to learn, test, and embed in their applications. Moreover, Skills Network provides images for all of these services so learners can _deploy_ the services to the provided Code Engine Project, alongisde their applcations (only availble in CloudIDE with Kubernetes and CloudIDE with Openshift).

### Using the provided Services 

All of the services are available to all Cloud IDE learners, for all flavours of Cloud IDE. For example the Text-To-Speech can be accessed at: https://sn-watson-tts.labs.skills.network. To help learners both know what services are available and how to use them the Skills Network Toolbox provides a page for each of the Embeddable AI services which shows:
  - Name and brief description
  - Available Models
  - Link to Documentation
  - Example Commands (with button to easily copy or run in terminal)

<details>
  <summary><b><u>View Screenshot</u></b></summary>
  <img width="422" alt="Skills Network Toolbox interface displaying various AI and NLP tools. Categories include Databases, Big Data, Cloud, and Embeddable AI. Under Embeddable AI, active features include Text-To-Speech and Speech-To-Text. The Watson NLP section lists active features such as Sentiment (BERT, CNN), Categories, Classification, Concepts, Detag, Emotion, Keywords, Language Detection, Noun Phrases, Relations (Transformer), and Syntax. Features labeled 'Coming Soon' include Entity-Mentions (BERT) and Relations (SIRE)." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/276912/215758158-2c8022b5-7d03-454e-a0bf-ed75e0d08d7d.png" />
</details>

Moreover, as an author, within Author IDE, you can add Buttons to your lab's markdown instructions to help learners open these pages with a simple button click. For example, the following markdown creates a button that launches an application running on port 5000:

```
::startApplication{port="5000" display="internal" name="Web Application" route="/"}  
```

The following markdown creates a button that opens the file `test.py` located in the `/home/project` directory:

```
::openFile{path="/home/project/test.py"}
```

### Building and Deploying to Code Engine (CloudIDE with Kubernetes, CloudIDE with Openshift)
If you would like to deploy any of the above-mentioned Embeddable AI NLP service and have it be available for anyone to use, you can follow these steps in order to deploy it. The deployment will be to IBM Cloudâ€™s Code Engine. IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed, cloud-native service for running containerized workloads on IBM Cloud. It allows developers to deploy and run code in a secure, scalable and serverless environment, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary><b><u>Deploying to Skills Network Code Engine</u></b></summary>

The following steps allow you to test deploy to a IBM's Code Engine envrionement which is managed by Skills Network. This deployment is relatively easier and is recommended to quickly test out that if everything is working just fine.<br/>
**Note: This deployment is temporary and is deleted after a few days.**

##### 1. Create Code Engine Project

In the left hand navigation pannel, there is an option for the Skills Network Toolbox. Simply open that and that expand the *CLOUD* section and then click on *Code Engine*. Finally cick on Create Project.

![Cloud IDE interface displaying the Code Engine panel. The Code Engine status is marked as 'Inactive' and 'Not Ready'. A blue 'Create Project' button is highlighted in red. The left sidebar menu includes options such as Databases, Big Data, Cloud, and Other. The Code Engine section is selected, and an AI-related icon is highlighted on the sidebar.](/img/labs/code-engine-create-project.png "Create Code Engine Project")

##### 2. Click on Code Engine CLI Button

From the same page simply click on Code Engine CLI button. This will open a new terminal and will login to a code engine project with everything alraedy set up for you.

![Cloud IDE interface showing the Code Engine panel with status marked as 'Ready to Use'. A blue 'Delete Project' button is visible. Below, the summary section provides instructions on using Code Engine. A 'Code Engine CLI' button is highlighted in red, indicating where users can click to access the CLI for interacting with Code Engine. The left sidebar includes categories such as Databases, Big Data, Cloud, and Other, with 'Code Engine' marked as Active.](/img/labs/code-engine-cli-button.png "Code Engine CLI")

**Note:** If you get an error `No project selected`, run the following commands in the Code Engine CLI terminal.

To list all active projects, use:

```
ibmcloud ce project list
```

Take note of the project ID you want to select then run this command to select the project:

```
ibmcloud ce project select -id <project_id>
```

##### 3. Choose and deploy your desired Embeddable AI image

To get started, simply run the following command in the terminal and choose the Watson's AI model you would like to use.

```bash
ibmcloud cr image-list --restrict sn-labsassets
```

After you execute the above command, terminal will output all the different NLP images available. You can then simply choose one of them by copying it's url. For this example, let's say you want to deploy the `us.icr.io/sn-labsassets/sentiment-bert-watson-nlp-runtime` model to Code Engine.

Then in the same terminal, run the following commands to deploy the model:

```bash
# Choose an app name for your Code Engine application
APP_NAME="Replace with your Code Engine Application Name"

# Replace with your desired Watson NLP image
CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL="us.icr.io/sn-labsassets/sentiment-bert-watson-nlp-runtime"
```

You an also set a visibility for your application, we would recommened to keep it as `project` to restrict any external traffic to it, and only allow the applications within your code engine project to be able to communicate with it as desired. For more infomration about visibility, check out the IBM Cloud Code Engine docs [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#optionsvisibility).

```bash
VISIBILITY=project
```

```bash
ibmcloud ce application create \
--name ${APP_NAME} \
--env ACCEPT_LICENSE=true \
--image ${CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL} \
--registry-secret icr-secret \
--visibility ${VISIBILITY}
```

After the application is ready, it will display the deployed NLP service URL in the terminal. You can then utilize this service URL in the same way as the other pre-existing Watson NLP services provided by Skills Network, and directly incorporate it into any of your other applications that have been deployed to Code Engine.

<details>
  <summary><b><u>Deploying to your personal IBM Cloud account's Code Engine</u></b></summary>

The following steps allow you to deploy the Watson NLP models to your personal IBM Cloud account's Code Engine envrionement. This deployment has some prerequisites and extra steps but ensures that your deployment is permanent untill you delete it yourself. 

##### Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have registered for a IBM Cloud account and have enabled the billing. You can [try it at no charge](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?target=/codeengine/overview) and receive USD$200 in cloud credits.

##### 1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account

Using the `ibmcloud login` command log into your own IBM Cloud account. Remember to replace `USERNAME` with your IBM Cloud account email and then enter your password when promted to.

```bash
ibmcloud login -u USERNAME
```
Use `ibmcloud login --sso` command to login, if you have a federated ID.

Then target any specific resource group in your account. By default, if you've completed the sign up process for your IBM Cloud account, you can use the `Default` resource group.

```bash
ibmcloud target -g Default
```

##### 2. Login to the IBM Entitled Registry

You'll need to login to IBM Entitled Registry to download the desired Watson NLP models so you can deploy them to your own Code Engine project.

Go [IBM's Container Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) to get an Entitlement Key. This Key gives you access to pulling and using the IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. However, do note that **this key is only valid for a Year as a trial.**

Once you've obtained the Entitlement Key from the container software library you can login to the registry with the key, and pull the images.

Replace it with your own IBM Entitlement Key.

```bash
IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY="YOUR_IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY"
```

Login to docker registry to pull the images.

```bash
echo $IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY | docker login -u cp --password-stdin cp.icr.io
```

##### 3. Choose and build your desired Embeddable AI image

Similar to deploying the image to Skills Network managed Code Engine, you will first need to choose a model from the [model catalog](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-libraries?topic=models-catalog).

Using the same example as above, let's say you want to deploy the `sentiment_aggregated-bert-workflow_lang_multi_stock` model to Code Engine.

Simply copy it's *Container Image* url as shown below.

![Sentiment model catalog table displaying information for BERT models. The table includes columns for Model ID, Container Image, and Image Digest. The highlighted row shows the model ID as 'sentiment_aggregated-bert-workflow_lang_multi_stock' and the container image URL as 'cp.icr.io/cp/ai/watson-nlp_sentiment_aggregated-bert-workflow_lang_multi_stock:1.0.9'. The Image Digest column contains a long hash value.](/img/labs/models-catalog-container-image-url.png "Models Catalog Container Image")

Now simply run the following commands in a terminal to download the chosen model to *models* directory:

```bash
CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL="Replace with the conatiner image url for your chosen model"
mkdir models
docker run -it --rm -e ACCEPT_LICENSE=true -v `pwd`/models:/app/models ${CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL}
```
After this create a new file called `Dockerfile` and add the following contents to it:

```bash
ARG TAG=1.0
FROM cp.icr.io/cp/ai/watson-nlp-runtime:${TAG}
COPY models /app/models
```
Finally build your image by executing this command in your terminal:

```bash
docker build -t my-watson-nlp-runtime:latest
```

##### 4 Create a namespace and log in to ICR

You will need to create a namespace before you can upload your images, and make sure you're targeting the ICR region you want, which right now is `global`.

Choose a name for your namespace, specified as `${NAMESPACE}`, and create the namespace. Currently, it's set to `my-embeddable-ai`, you can choose to rename it to anything you choose.

```bash
NAMESPACE=my-embeddable-ai
```

```bash
ibmcloud cr region-set global
ibmcloud cr namespace-add ${NAMESPACE}
ibmcloud cr login
```

##### 6. Push your image to your namespace

```bash
REGISTRY=icr.io

# Tag and push the image
docker tag my-watson-nlp-runtime:latest ${REGISTRY}/${NAMESPACE}/my-watson-nlp-runtime:latest
docker push ${REGISTRY}/${NAMESPACE}/my-watson-nlp-runtime:latest
```

##### 7. Deploy the image to Code Engine

**1:** Target a region and a resource group

Choose the region closest to you and/or your target users. Picking a region closer to you or your users makes the browser extension faster. The further the region the longer the request to the model has to travel.

You can choose any region from this list:

#### Americas
- `us-south` - Dallas
- `br-sao` - Sao Paulo
- `ca-tor` - Toronto
- `us-east` - Washington DC

#### Europe
- `eu-de` - Frankfurt
- `eu-gb` - London

#### Asia Pacific
- `au-syd` - Sydney
- `jp-tok` - Tokyo

Use the following commands to target Dallas as the region and the Default resource group.

```bash
REGION=us-south
RESOURCE_GROUP=Default
```

```bash
ibmcloud target -r ${REGION} -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```

**2:** Create and Select a new Code Engine project

In this example, a project named `my-test-project` will be create in the resource group set by the previous command.

```bash
ibmcloud ce project create --name my-test-project
ibmcloud ce project select --name my-test-project
```

**3:** Deploy Watson NLP Image

Choose a app name for your Code Engine application and set the container image url you just copied.

```bash
APP_NAME="Replace with your Code Engine Application Name"
```

You an also set a visibility for your application, we would recommened to keep it as `project` to restrict any external traffic to it, and only allow the applications within your code engine project to be able to communicate with it as desired. For more infomration about visibility and other optional parameters, check out the IBM Cloud Code Engine docs [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads).

```bash
VISIBILITY=project
```

```bash
ibmcloud ce application create \
  --name ${APP_NAME} \
  --port 1080 \
  --min-scale 1 --max-scale 2 \
  --cpu 2 --memory 8G \
  --image private.${REGISTRY}/${NAMESPACE}/my-watson-nlp-runtime:latest \
  --registry-secret ce-auto-icr-private-${REGION} \
  --visibility ${VISIBILITY} \
  --env ACCEPT_LICENSE=true
```

After the application is ready, it will display the deployed NLP service URL in the terminal. You can then utilize this service URL in the same way as the other pre-existing Watson NLP services provided by Skills Network, and directly incorporate it into any of your other applications that have been deployed to Code Engine.

## Framework-Specific Infomation

### Flutter Web and Cloud IDE

Flutter Webâ€™s hot restart feature, which allows developers to see changes instantly by pressing r in the terminal, doesnâ€™t work as expected in the Cloud IDE due to differences in the environment.

However, thereâ€™s a simple workaround with a bash script to mimic the hot reload functionality. Click [here](../flutter-web-hot-restart.md) for more information on how to use this workaround.

## Tips on Writing a Successful CloudIDE Lab

Creating an effective CloudIDE lab requires careful planning to ensure learners have a smooth and engaging experience. Below are key tips to enhance the structure and learning outcomes of your lab.

### 1. Provide an overview of the final application early  
If your lab involves building an application, include an overview within the first few pages. This helps learners understand the end goal and visualize what they will achieve by the end of the lab.

![An overview of AI NutriCoach app interface displaying an image-based nutritional analysis tool. The interface includes an 'Upload Image' section where users can upload a food image. There are options for entering dietary restrictions and selecting a workflow type (recipe or analysis). The results section provides a nutritional breakdown of the dish, including estimated calories and macronutrient content. A table on the right side lists example images, dietary restrictions, and workflow types.](/img/labs/app-overview-example.png "App Overview Example")

<center> *Example - AI NutriCoach App Overview* </center>

### 2. Include a **"Tips for the best experience"** page  
Early in the lab, provide a dedicated **"Tips for the best experience"** page to help learners navigate the tutorial smoothly. This page should serve as a reference point for troubleshooting and best practices throughout the lab. Key elements to include:  

- **Guidance on Navigation** â€“ Explain how to use the **Table of Contents** to quickly find sections and avoid getting lost.  
- **Quick Start Option** â€“ Offer a **fast-track** method for learners who want to see the final result early.  
- **Cloud IDE Best Practices** â€“ Cover essential tips such as **saving work, running code blocks, and ensuring the correct project directory**.  
- **Application Execution Instructions** â€“ Provide reminders on keeping `app.py` running, using the correct port, and refreshing the application when needed.  
- **Troubleshooting Tips** â€“ Include solutions for common issues like **server errors, unstable models, or access problems**.  

This page acts as a **go-to cheat sheet** that learners can refer back to whenever they encounter confusion or errors.

![Screenshot of the 'Tips for the Best Experience - Please Read!' page in a tutorial. The page provides guidance on following a quick version of the tutorial, using the Table of Contents for navigation, and saving work. A highlighted red box emphasizes the Table of Contents icon in the top left corner, showing a dropdown menu with a list of tutorial sections. Additional tips on saving work and retrieving updated scripts at the end of each section are also visible.](/img/labs/tips-for-best-experience.png "Tips for best experience example")

<center> *Example - Tips for best experience* </center>

### 3. Offer two learning versions
To accommodate different learning styles and time constraints, provide two options:  
- **Quick version:** Guide learners to get the final application up and running within the first few pages. This helps those who want quick results.
![Screenshot of the 'Quick version - run the final app' page in a tutorial. The page provides a step-by-step guide to quickly setting up and running the NutriCoach application. It includes three main steps: cloning the GitHub repository, setting up a Python virtual environment, and installing required libraries. The page emphasizes that this section is for users who want to get the final app running immediately, with a disclaimer advising others to skip ahead for the full tutorial. Code snippets with run buttons are included for ease of execution.](/img/labs/short-course-example.png "Quick version example")

<center> *Example - Quick version* </center>

- **Full version:** Once the application is running, encourage learners to continue through the rest of the lab to explore deeper explanations, code breakdowns, and additional insights.

By structuring your CloudIDE lab in this way, you can cater to both quick learners who want a fast setup and those who prefer an in-depth understanding of the implementation.
