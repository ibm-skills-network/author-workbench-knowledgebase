# Add a Lab to your Coursera Course

Once you have created a lab, you then need to **add it to your course via Coursera**. When you are adding a lab to your course, you **embed your lab into a unit of your course**. This way, learners will naturally progress through the course, and complete your labs as they go.

## Add an Instructional Lab to your Course

> This section is only for instructional labs. If you wish to add a different lab type to your course, see the [Add a (Non-Instructional) Lab to your Course](#add-a-non-instructional-lab-to-your-course) section below.

As a Skills Network author, you can create "instructional labs". These are labs that include step by step instructions for working with tools external to Skills Network Labs, such as services on IBM Cloud. 

HTML files will be automatically generated from instructional labs so they can be easliy embedded or linked to from your course. To embed an instructional lab in your course, follow the steps below.

1. On your course page, navigate to the lab you want (under the `Labs` tab) and click "Add to Course"
