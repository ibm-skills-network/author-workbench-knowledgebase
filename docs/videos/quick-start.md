# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the process of adding your first video to Author Workbench.

## What is a Video?

Author Workbench supports uploading videos from your computer to use in your course(s). Once uploaded, your videos will all be nicely organized in the course they were uploaded to under the **Content > Videos** tab. If you have a video you want to use in multiple courses, you can easily reuse it with the "Add from a Course" option.

Each video in Author Workbench is automatically transcribed using AI. You can review and edit the transcriptions to ensure accuracy. To make your content even more accessible, Author Workbench automatically translates the transcription into multiple languages with AI. To use these features, you don't need to do anything. They are enabled by default and as soon as you upload the video, Author Workbench will start working on the transcription and translations.

## Creating your first Video

It's easy to upload your videos in Author Workbench. If you're doing this for the first time, you'll need to first create a [course](/docs/courses/quick-start) so that you have a place to upload your videos. Once you have a course, you can navigate to **Content > Videos** and then click **Upload Video**. Here, you can upload 1 or more video files from your computer.

That's it!

### Working with your Video

**Once you've uploaded your video**, you will see three key buttons.

- **Manage**: Here you can rename your video to help you organize things
- **Preview**: Here you can watch the video, preview the transcript and edit the transcript
- **Embed**: Add your video to your [course outline](/docs/courses/quick-start#the-course-outline)

### Adding your video to your course

Once you've uploaded your video, you can add it to your course outline. Like any other course resource, a video must be inserted into the course outline for learners to access it. Click **Embed** on your video and you'll see instructions on how to add the video to your course outline. These instructions are different depending on your platform.

For Skills Network courses, simply click **Copy HTML** to copy the HTML for the embedded video player. Then, open the desired unit in your course outline. Under **Add New Component** select the green **Text** option and then select **Raw HTML**. Edit the Raw HTML block you just added and paste the HTML you copied from the video embed modal. Click **Save** and you're done.
