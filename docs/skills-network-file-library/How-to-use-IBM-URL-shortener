How to create a trackable link using IBM's link shortener:

In this article, I will be demonstrating how to create a trackable link using IBM's link shortener, and how it can be used to promote IBM products featured in our Guided projects and courses. By using a trackable link, we can assess the success of our promotions and optimize our marketing strategies accordingly.


To get started, you first need to sign into IBM's link shortener system. Once you're logged in, you can add the link of your target into the "snip it" section (as shown in the image below, section 1). After adding the link, you will receive a confirmation of your snipped URL with the ability to edit and customize it (as shown in the images below, section 2 & 3).


 

Once the snipped URL is available, you can insert it into your content such as a course or guided project.

If you need to edit the snipped URL, you can click on the settings icon from the "Current Snips" window (as shown in the image below). From there, you can access the "edit snip options" section and edit the target link as well as the snipped URL. You can also add rules to determine if your snipped URL will go to a different URL based on factors such as time of day, date and time, language, or location.

Finally, the "view metrics" option shows all the statistics of the viewed targets, and you can transfer your snip code to another person within the company.
