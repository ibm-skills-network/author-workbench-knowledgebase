## How to Build a Guided Project

Congratulations on creating your Guided Project. This article will walk you through the steps to create and publish a Guided Project.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't went through our onboarding process, please visit https://www.skills.network/authoring/ first and follow the instructions.

## Get Started

Upon creating a project, you should see the following screen:

You will see three major components:

- GitLab Project
- Asset Library
- Skills Network Studio

## Authoring

### GitLab Project

This is where most of the work is done and where you will author the content of your Guided Project. The GitLab project is created with a template, so make sure you go through the `README.md` file in your GitLab project.

### Asset Library

Whenever you make any changes to your content on the GitLab project, they will be published to asset library and a public URL will be generated. You should only share assets with links you obtain from asset library with your learners.

Clicking `Open Asset Library` will bring you to the following page. Hovering your mouse over the `instructions.md` file allows you to test your content in the Skills Network Lab environment. Clicking the `clipboard` icon will copy the public URL of your content to your clipboard. You will be needing this link when publishing your Guided Project in the section below.

## Publishing

### Submit for Review

Once you are done authoring your content and are ready to make it publicly available through our platform. Go back to your project on Author Workbench and click `Publish`.

You are required to include a release note for every new version. Note that this text will be made available to all learners, so write something that makes sense to your learners.

Depending on the tool your are using, fill in the form.

Upon submission, our curation team will review your content. We will reach out if there are any issues.
