# Quick Start

When you first sign up for Author Workbench, you'll be asked to create a profile. This profile is your personal page on Author Workbench and is crucial to your success as an author. Take the time to create a profile that reflects your professional information, credentials,and social media links.

We recommend you complete your profile before you start creating content. Try to get your profile strength as high as possible!

## Creating Your Profile

You should have already added some basic profile information like your name, picture and bio when you signed up as part of onboarding. To see how learners would see your profile, you can click "[My Profile](https://author.skills.network/profile)" on the left navigation bar.

## Editing Your Profile

To edit your profile, simply click the "[Edit Profile](https://author.skills.network/profile/edit)" button on your profile page. Here you can add more detailed information about yourself, your credentials, and your social media links. Remember to save your changes.

You can also manage your private account settings and connected accounts on this page.

## Best Practices

- Keep your profile information up-to-date.
- Use a professional photo.
- Provide links to your professional social media accounts.
- We always recommend you add a secondary connected account here as a backup login.

That's it! You've successfully created and edited your author profile. Make sure to keep it updated to reflect your latest achievements and contributions.
